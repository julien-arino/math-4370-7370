\section{Definitions and some preliminary results}

\begin{frame}
\begin{definition}[Nonnegative/positive matrix]
  \label{def:nonnegative_matrix}
A matrix $A\in \M_{mn}(\IR)$ is a \defword{nonnegative matrix} if $a_{ij}\geq 0$ for all $i=1,\ldots,m$ and $j=1,\ldots,n$. We write $A\geq 0$. $A$ is a \defword{positive matrix} if $a_{ij}>0$ for all $i=1,\ldots,m$ and $j=1,\ldots,n$. We write $A>0$
\end{definition}
\vfill
\begin{remark}
In other references, you will see
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A\geq 0 \iff a_{ij}\geq 0$
    \item $A>0 \iff A\geq 0$ and there exists $(i,j)$, $a_{ij}>0$ 
    \hfill [positive]
    \item $A\gg 0 \iff a_{ij}>0$ for all $i,j$ \hfill [strongly positive]
\end{itemize}
I tend to favour the latter notation over the one used in these notes, but since the former is more common in matrix theory, I use the notation of Definition~\ref{def:nonnegative_matrix} here
\end{remark}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Notation}
Let $A,B\in\M_{mn}(\IR)$. Nonnegativity and positivity are used to define partial orders on $\M_{mn}(\IR)$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A\geq B \iff A-B\geq 0$
    \item $A>B \iff A-B >0$
\end{itemize}
The same is used for vectors $\bx,\by\in\IR^n$: $\bx\geq\by$ and $\bx>\by$ if, respectively, $\bx-\by\geq\b0$ and $\bx-\by>\b0$. Note that the order is only partial: if $A\geq 0$ and $B\geq 0$, for instance, it is not necessarily possible to decide on the ordering of $A$ and $B$ with respect to one another
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}\label{th:nonnegative_matrices_semigroup}
Let $A$ and $B$ be nonnegative matrices of appropriate sizes. Then $A+B$ and $AB$ are nonnegative. 
If $A>0$ and $B\geq 0$, $B\neq 0$, then $AB\geq 0$ and $AB\neq 0$
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\begin{corollary}\label{coro:nonnegativity_preserves_orientation}
Let $\bx,\by\in\IR^n$ be such that $\bx\geq\by$ and $A\in \M_{mn}$ be nonnegative. Then $A\bx\geq A\by$. 
Assume additionally that $\bx\geq\by$, $\bx\neq\by$ and $A>0$. Then $A\bx>A\by$
\end{corollary}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Zero-nonzero structure of a matrix}
\begin{frame}
\begin{definition}
Let $P,Q\in \M_{nm}(\IF)$. $P$ and $Q$ have the same \defword{zero-nonzero structure} if for all $i,j$, $p_{ij}\neq 0 \iff q_{ij}\neq 0$
\end{definition}
\vfill
Zero-nonzero structure defines an equivalence relation. Therefore, as with all equivalence relations, one only needs one representative from the equivalence class. One typical representative is defined using Boolean matrices
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{definition}
A \defword{Boolean matrix}\index{Boolean matrix} is a matrix whose entries are Boolean $\{0,1\}$ and use Boolean arithmetics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0+0=0$
    \item $1+0=0+1=1$
    \item $1+1=1$
    \item $0\cdot 1= 1$ and $ 1= 0= 0\cdot 0$
    \item $1\cdot 1=1$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} 
Let $A\in \M_{nm}(\IF)$.
Then $A_B$ denotes the \defword{Boolean representation} of $A$, defined as follows. If $A=[a_{ij}]$, then $A_B=[\alpha_{ij}]$ with
\[
\alpha_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
1& \textrm{if }a_{ij}\neq 0\\
0& \textrm{if }a_{ij}=0
\end{cases}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $P,], Q\in \M_{n}$ be nonnegative matrices. The zero-nonzero structure of the sum of product of $P$ and $Q$ is uniquely determined by the zero-nonzero structure of $P$ and $Q$. Also,
\begin{align*}
    (P+B)_B &= P_B+Q_B\\
    (PQ)_B& = P_BQ_B
\end{align*}
 (with Boolean addition and multiplication on the right).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{th:aij_positive_path_length_k}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a nonnegative matrix, $k\in \IN\setminus\{0\}$. Then the $(i,j)$ entry in $A^k$ is nonzero if and only if there is a directed walk of length \emph{exactly} $k$ from $i$ to $j$ in $G(A)$, the digraph associated to $A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
The walk can go thought the same vertex more than once.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}\label{th:sum_of_irreducible_matrices_positive}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a nonnegative and irreducible, $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{n-1}\in \IR_{+}\setminus\{0\}$. Then 
\[
\alpha_0\II+\alpha_1A+\cdots+ \alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1}>0.
\]
In particular, $(\II+A)^{n-1}>0$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{definition}
Let $A\in \M_n(\IF)$. The matrix $m(A)= [| a_{ij}|]$ is the \defword{modulus}\index{matrix!modulus} of $A$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
$A,\, B\in \M_n(\IF)$, $A$ potentially complex. Suppose $m(A)<B$. Then $\rho(A)\leq \rho(B)$. In particular, $\rho(A)\leq \rho(m(A))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{AnonnegativeB}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a nonnegative matrix, $0 \neq z\in \IR^n  $. If $\exists b\in \IR$ such that $Az>bz$, then $\rho(A)>b$.
\end{lemma}
Note that the latter result also holds true if $>$ is replaced by $\geq$. See \cite[Theorem 8.3.2]{HornJohnson2013} and a proof there in the latter case.
Note, however, that the proof of \cite[Theorem 8.3.2]{HornJohnson2013} uses Perron's Lemma. So it is better for our purpose here to use the proof in \cite{Fiedler2008}, where this result is Lemma 4.1.6.

\subsection{The Perron-Frobenius Theorem for irreducible matrices}
\label{sec:PF_irreducible_matrices}

\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}[Perron-Frobenius]\index{Perron-Frobenius Theorem}\label{th:PF}
Let $A\geq 0\in \M_n$ be irreducible. Then the spectral radius $\rho(A)= \max \{ |\lambda|, \lambda\in \sigma(A)\}$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. It is simple (has algebraic multiplicity 1), positive and is associated with a positive eigenvector. Furthermore, there is no nonnegative eigenvector associated to any other eigenvalue of $A$
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\begin{remark}
We often say that $\rho(A)$ is the \defword{Perron root} of $A$; the corresponding eigenvector is the \defword{Perron vector} of $A$
\end{remark}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proof of a result of Perron for positive matrices}
\label{sec:proof_Perron}

\begin{frame}
\begin{lemma}[Perron]\index{Perron's Lemma}\label{lemma:Perron}
Let $\M_n\ni A>0$. Then $\rho(A)$ is a positive eigenvalue of $A$ and there is only one linearly independent eigenvector associated to $\rho(A)$, which can be taken to be positive
\end{lemma}
\vfill
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:prep_Perron}
Let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\in\IR^{*}_{+}$ and $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in\IC$. Then
\begin{equation}\label{ineq:proof_Perron_1}
\left|\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i v_i\right| 
\leq 
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \alpha |v_i|
\end{equation}
with equality if and only if there exists $\eta\in\IC$, $|\eta|=1$, such that $\eta v_i\geq 0$ for all $i=1, \ldots, n$
\end{lemma}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Proof of the Perron-Frobenius theorem for irreducible matrices}
\label{sec:proof_PF}


\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}\label{CoolTh1}
Let $A\in \M_{n}$ and $f(x)$ a polynomial. Then 
\[
\sigma(f(A))= \{ f(\lambda_1), \ldots, f(\lambda_n), \lambda_i\in \sigma(A)\}
\]
If we have $g(\lambda_i)\neq 0$ for $\lambda_i\in \sigma(A)$, for some polynomial $g$, then the matrix $g(A)$ is non-singular and 
\[
\sigma\left(f(A)g(A)^{-1}\right)
= 
\left\lbrace \dfrac{f(\lambda_1)}{g(\lambda_1)},\ldots, \dfrac{f(\lambda_n)}{g(\lambda_n)}, \lambda_i\in \sigma(A) \right\rbrace
\]
If $x\neq 0$ eigenvector of $A$ associated to $\lambda\in \sigma(A)$, then $x$ is also an eigenvector of $f(A)$ and $f(A)g(A)^{-1}$ associated to eigenvalue $f(\lambda)$ and $f(\lambda)/g(\lambda)$, respectively
\end{theorem}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{lemma}[Schur's lemma]\label{lemma:Schur_LI_evectors}
Let $A\in \M_n$ and $\lambda\in \sigma(A)$. 
Then $\lambda$ is simple if and only if both the following conditions are statisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
     \item There exists only one linear independent eigenvector of $A$ associated to $\lambda$, say $\bu$, and thus only one linear independent eigenvector of $A^T$ associated to $\lambda$, say $\bv$
     \item Vectors $\bu$ and $\bv$ in (1) satisfy $\bv^T\bu\neq 0$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Primitive matrices}
\label{sec:primitivity}


\begin{frame}
\begin{definition}
Let $\M_n(\IR)\ni A\geq 0$.
We say that $A$ is \defword{primitive} (with \defword{primitivity index} $k\in \IN_{+}^{*}$) if there exists $k\in \IN_{+}^{*}$ such that 
\[
A^k>0
\]
with $k$ the smallest integer for which this is true.
We say that a matrix is \defword{imprimitive} if it is not primitive
\end{definition}
\vfill
\begin{remark}
Primitivity implies irreducibility. The converse is not true
\end{remark}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}
A sufficient condition for primitivity is irreducibility with at least one positive diagonal entry
\end{theorem}
\vfill
Here $d$ is the index of imprimitivity (i.e., the number of eigenvalues that have the same modulus as $\lambda_p=\rho(A)$). If $d=1$, then $A$ is primitive. We have that $d=\gcd$ of all the lengths of closed walks in $G(A)$
\vfill
\begin{theorem}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a non-negative matrix. If $A$ is primitive, then $A^k>0$ for some $0<k\leq (n-1)n^n$
\end{theorem}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}
Let $A\geq 0$ primtive. Suppose the shortest simple directed cycle in $G(A)$ has length $s$, then primitivity index is $\leq n+s(n-1)$
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\begin{theorem}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a nonnegative matrix. $A$ is primitive if and only if $A^{n^2-2n+2}>0$
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\begin{theorem}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a nonnegative irreducible matrix . Suppose that $A$ has $d$ positive entries on the diagonal. Then the primitivity index is $\leq 2n-d-1$

\subsection{The Perron-Frobenius Theorem (revamped)}
\label{sec:PF_summary}

\begin{frame}
Let us restate the Perron-Frobenius theorem, taking into account the different cases.
The classification in the following result is inspired by the presentation in \cite{Caswell2001}.
\begin{theorem}\label{th:PF_allCases}
Let $\M_n\ni A\geq 0$. Denote $\lambda_P$ the Perron root of $A$, i.e., $\lambda_P=\rho(A)$, $\bv_P$ and $\bw_P$ the corresponding right and left Perron vectors of $A$, respectively. 
Denote $d$ the index of imprimitivity of $A$ (with $d=1$ when $A$ is primitive) and $\lambda_j\in\sigma(A)$ the spectrum of $A$, with $j=2,\ldots,n$ unless otherwise specified (assuming $\lambda_1=\lambda_P$).
Then conclusions of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem can be summarised as follows.
\end{theorem}

\label{sec:applications_PF}


\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}
Let $A\in \M_n$ be a nonnegative irreducible matrix and $\in \IN_{+}$. Then the following ar eequivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item there exists exactly $h$ distinct eigenvalues such that $|\lambda| = \rho(A)$.
    \item there exists $P$ a permutation matrix such that 
    \[PAP^{T}= \begin{pmatrix}

    \vdots&& &\ddots&0 \\
    \vdots&& && A_{h-1,h}\\
    A_{h1} &0&\ldots& \ldots & 0

    where the diagonal blocks are square, and there does not exists other permutation matrix giving less than $h$ horizontal blocks.
    \item the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all cycles in $G(A)$ is $h$.
