## Information about the project

The final project is the most heavily weighted part of this course, worth 40% of your final mark. It is therefore important to devote a substantial amount of time to it.

### Types of projects

You can work on three different types of projects.
1. *Self-selected topic*. That is often the option chosen by graduate students, who find a topic close to their own work project.
2. *Assigned topic*. You have a vague idea of something that you find interesting but don't really know what to do. I will assign a paper for you to go over and "unfold". Most mathematical papers are scarce on details because the readers are expected to be trained mathematicians. Your job will be to explain the paper in such a way that you could present it to the class, over potentially several lectures, in a way that people without knowledge of all these "hidden" pieces would be able to understand.
3. *Course notes*. Imagine I left on a trip and I asked you to stand in for me for one (students registered in 4370) or two (students registered in 7370) weeks. These course notes cannot intersect with mine and would typically focus on one specific topic.

### Timeline

Early in the term, I will ask you to fill an online form where you will indicate what type of project you would like to choose, domain area, etc. 

Some of you are used to writing reports or papers, others not at all. To help everyone with the project, two assignments are specifically designed to guide you. These two assignments have specific deadlines, although you are free to return them before the deadline.
1. Project Assignment 1 is due at 23:59 on Friday 6 October
2. Project assignment 2 is due at 23:59 on Friday 17 November

I will strive to mark both of these assignments within one week of receiving them. 

In the ideal situation, you will get an "all good" from me and just carry on. If I am not satisfied that the project is fitting of either the level or the content of the course, then I will indicate this on the assignment and will follow up with you in a one-on-one meeting to clarify or redirect your work.

*Note*: my evaluation of these assignments regards your following of the rules of the assignment, not
